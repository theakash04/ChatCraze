# Chatcraze Chat Application

**Chatcraze** is a chat application developed to learn WebSocket communication and explore hosting options. It uses **FastAPI** for the backend and **Next.js** for the frontend. The application is containerized with **Docker** using a multi-container setup managed by **Docker Compose**. 

---

## Features
- Real-time communication powered by WebSockets.
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL as the database.
- Next.js frontend for a seamless chat experience.
- Fully containerized for easy deployment.

## Installation and Running Locally

### Prerequisites
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.
2. Ensure `docker-compose` is available via the command line.
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chatcraze
   ```

### Running with Docker

#### 1. Build and Start the Containers
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
This will:
- Build the backend and frontend Docker images.
- Start the PostgreSQL database, backend, and frontend services.
- Create necessary networks and volumes.

#### 2. Access the Application
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### 3. Stopping the Services
To stop the containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Running Locally Without Docker

You can run the backend and frontend independently without Docker:

#### 1. Setup PostgreSQL Database
Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed locally and create a database with the required credentials:
```bash
CREATE DATABASE chatcraze;
CREATE USER chatcraze_user WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE chatcraze TO chatcraze_user;
```

Update the environment variables in `.env` files under the `Root` directory.

#### 2. Running the Backend
Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### 3. Running the Frontend
Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the application:
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
